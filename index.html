        <p class="lead">I was born and raised in Memphis, TN. I went to school at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville and
            received my Bachelor's degree in 2017. I have been working in the Accounting field for 2 years, and I am
            currently seeking for a new career in the tech industry.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">I enjoy hanging out with my friends and staying active. I also like to explore new cities. 
            I have been consistently lifting weights for about 10 weeks. I used to actively run and train for half marathon races, but
            since several injuries, I have reduced my running distance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead"> I am trying to add more words to my about me page, so it can look fuller. It's so hard to talk about myself.
            I did my best on this homework. I worked on it for over 10 hours. Even though it was
            very frustrating, I still enjoyed working on it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">I am excited about being in this coding bootcamp. I can't wait to see
            where my future is headed after this course.
